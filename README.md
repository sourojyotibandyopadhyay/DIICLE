# DIICLE
DIICLE stands for Discover.Innovate.Inspire.Create.Learn.Evolve. Pretty weird for a name but has a solid concept. It is designed as a place where one can get access to a new form of video games which we are calling game-series. These are games divided into a number of playable episodes. If you really have nothing else to do, or want to learn something in a playful way, you can come to DIICLE.
